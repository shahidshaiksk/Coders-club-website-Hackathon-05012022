    Code powers our digital world. Coding is an incredible skill that engages both our creative and problem solving skills. In today’s world that is increasingly influenced by software,
     we need to produce graduates with outstanding problem solving and coding abilities. Coders’ Club at GPREC strives to meet this objective.

    Objectives :

            Solve problems using Math, Data structures & Algorithms.
            Write correct, efficient and elegant code.
            Crack the coding interviews at product based companies.
            Compete with students studying at other top institutes.
